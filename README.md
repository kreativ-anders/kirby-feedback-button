## Why an Add-On?
IMHO a Plug-in does not make sense due to interoperability. 
Also this kind of Add-On adapts way more easy to **YOUR** project.

## Installation:
1. Download latest release.
2. Paste folder into plugins folder of Kirby.
3. Done!

## Configuration

### config.php
````php
'kreativ-anders.feedback-button.color' => 'black',`      // HEX, RGB(A), COLOR ... WHATEVER YOU DESIRE
  'kreativ-anders.feedback-button.accounts' => [
    [ 'name'  => 'WhatsApp'
     ,'url' => 'https://wa.me/491512345678910'],         // JUST KEEP THE CORRECT URLs IN MIND
    [ 'name'  => 'Email'
     ,'url' => 'mailto:hello@kreativ-anders.de'],
  ]
````

## Notes:
