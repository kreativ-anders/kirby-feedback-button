## Why an Add-On?
IMHO a Plug-in does not make sense due to interoperability. 
Also this kind of Add-On adapts way more easy to **YOUR** project.

## Installation:
1. Unzip the files.
1. Paste (overwrite) the folder *content* and *site* on top of the root folder of your Kirby installation.
1. Done!

## Notes:
This Add-On is built for Kirby CMS based on **Kirby´s Starterkit Version 3.5.0**. 

In case you are using Kirby´s Plainkit ensure to add the pages/links for the following pages somewhere in your snippets or templates!

- Register 
- Login
- Logout
- User
